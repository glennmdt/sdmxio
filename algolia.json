Here is my story with Cloud Native. Origin The first time to attend the Cloud Native Computing Foundation is at the LC3 in Beijing 2017. I attended the meeting again this year, and in November of this year, CNCF will hold the KubeCon \u0026amp; CloudNativeCon for the first time in Shanghai, China. I\u0026rsquo;ll be there too. Cloud Native Books My origins with the Cloud Native is originated from Kevin Hoffman\u0026rsquo;s book Cloud Native Go . I translated this book at the end of 2016.

This article will show you how to debug microservices in Kubernetes, introduce common tools, and explain how the introduction of Istio impacts debugging microservices.\nDebugging microservices is vastly different from traditional monolithic applications The debugging of microservices has been a long-standing problem for software developers. This challenge does not exist in traditional monolithic applications because developers can leverage the debugger in IDEs to add breakpoints, modify environment variables, single-step execution, etc. for their applications, all of which provide great help in software debugging.","tags":["istio","service mesh","telepresence","nocalhost"],"title":"How to debug microservices in Kubernetes with proxy, sidecar or service mesh?"},{"categories":["Istio"],"date":1604306607,"description":"Better integration of virtual machine-based workloads into the service mesh is a major focus for the Istio team this year, and Tetrate also provides seamless multi-cloud connectivity, security and observability, including for virtual machines, through its product Tetrate Service Bridge.

When it was first introduced as open source in 2017, Kubernetes was winning the container orchestration battle and Istio answered the needs of organizations moving to microservices. Although Istio claims to support heterogeneous environments such as Nomad, Consul, Eureka, Cloud Foundry, Mesos, etc., in reality, it has always worked best with Kubernetes â€” on which its service discovery is based.\nIstio was criticized for a number of issues early in its development, for the large number of components, the complexity of installation and maintenance, the difficulty of debugging, a steep learning curve due to the introduction of too many new concepts and objects (up to 50 CRDs), and the impact of Mixer components on performance.","title":"How to Integrate Virtual Machines into Istio Service Mesh"},{"categories":["Istio"],"date":1605775407,"description":"WorkloadGroup is a new API object.

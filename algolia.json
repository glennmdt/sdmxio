In FMR they are defined as structural metadata using validation schemes. One option is to define explcit arithmetic expressions on specific variables in a dataset, but hierarchical codelists can also be used.\nDefining implict aggegation using hierarchical codelists Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

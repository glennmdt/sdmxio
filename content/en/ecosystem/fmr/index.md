## Fusion Metadata Registry

Fusion Metadata Registry (FMR) is first and foremost a **structural metadata registry** - essentially a database designed specifically for storing SDMX artefacts including Concepts, Codelists and Data Structure definitions. A centralised and controlled repository for metadata is useful in many cases where statistics are collected, produced and exchanged\
How?
- sharing and re-use
- standardisation 
- harmonisation of concepts helps to make datasets comparable and consistent
- by enabling metadata and data governance

This video was recorded on the last day of 2018 and demonstrates the use of [rootsongjc/kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster to](http://github.com/rootsongjc/kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster) automatically deploy a Kubernetes cluster and [Istio](https://istio.io/zh) Service Mesh.

A few days ago I mentioned that kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster released v1.2.0 version to deploy a cloud-native experimental environment with one click. Someone in the Kubernetes and Service Mesh community asked me a long time ago to make a video to explain and demonstrate how to install Kubernetes and Istio Service Mesh, because I'm always busy, I've always made some time. Today, I will give a demo video, just don't watch the video for a few minutes. In order to make this video, it took me half an hour to record, two hours to edit, and many years of shooting. , Editing, containers, virtual machines, Kubernetes, service grid experience. This is not so much a farewell as a new beginning.

Because the video was first [posted](https://youtu.be/26kbaZxcB4A) on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/26kbaZxcB4A) , it was explained in English (just a few supplementary instructions, it does n’t matter if you do n’t understand, just read the [Chinese documentation](https://github.com/rootsongjc/kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster/blob/master/README-cn.md) on GitHub ).

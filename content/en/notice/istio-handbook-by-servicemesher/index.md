Istio handbook was originally an open source e-book I created (see https://jimmysong.io/istio-handbook ). It has been written for 8 months before donating to the ServiceMesher community. In order to further popularize Istio and Service Mesh technology, this book Donate to the community for co-authoring. The content of the original book was migrated to https://github.com/servicemesher/istio-handbook on March 10, 2019. The original book will no longer be updated.

[Istio](https://istio.io/zh) is a service mesh framework jointly developed by Google, IBM, Lyft, etc., and began to enter the public vision in early 2017. As an important infrastructure layer that inherits Kubernetes and connects to the serverless architecture in the cloud-native era, Istio is of crucial importance important. [The ServiceMesher community,](http://www.servicemesher.com/) as one of the earliest open source communities in China that is researching and promoting Service Mesh technology, decided to integrate community resources and co-author an open source e-book for readers.

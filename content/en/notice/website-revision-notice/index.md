2020 is indeed a bad start. In less than a month, I hardly heard any good news:

Trump assassinated Major General Sulaymani of Iran; this pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan; the news that my basketball icon Kobe died of a helicopter crash really shocked me, and the Lakers said goodbye on the 24th. This gave me another spiritual blow during the Spring Festival, which was originally lacking in interest.

2020 is bound to be a year deeply remembered in all humankind. In the last few days of the first month of the year, I decided to revise the website. The first reason was that I could nâ€™t go out during the extended Chinese New Year holiday, and it was boring at home. And many pictures on the website were saved on Weibo map beds. The picture bed is unstable, causing many photos to be irretrievable; coupled with a habit of organizing the website every long holiday (the last revision of the website was completed during the National Day holiday in 2018, completed at home for 7 days), so I decided to The website has been revised again and it has become what it is now.

### Features

The website has the following features after this revision:

- Reorganize the website content, the structure is more reasonable

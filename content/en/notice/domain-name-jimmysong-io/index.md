From now on I have my own independent domain name [jimmysong.io](http://jimmysong.io/) , the website is still hosted on GitHub, the original URL [https://jimmysong.io is](https://jimmysong.io/) still accessible.

Why use .io as the suffix? Because this is **The First Step to Cloud Native!**

Why choose today? Because today is August 18, the days are easy to remember.

PS domain names are registered in [namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/) and cost tens of dollars / year.

1. Help to arrange the booth

**The other party can provide**

PS This is the most complete and best picture I have ever found of their team. (Photography needs to be strengthened)

Let's briefly introduce this startup called Ballerina. Their team is mainly from Sri Lanka. This is an island country next to India in the South Asian subcontinent. In ancient China, it was called "Lion Country" and rich in gemstones.

The capital of their country is Sri Lanka, which is pronounced in their own language: Si li jia ya wa de na pu la ke te

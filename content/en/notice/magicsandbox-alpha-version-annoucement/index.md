> If there is a visual learning model and platform that provides infrastructure clusters for your operation, would you pay for it?

Two months ago, I met Jord in Kubernetes's Slack channel, and later saw the link of MagicSandbox.io he (and possibly others) sent in the Facebook group of Taiwan Kubernetes User Group, and I clicked to apply for a trial Then, I received an email from Jord later, and he told me that he wanted to build a Kubernetes learning platform. That's where the whole thing started, and then we had a couple of Zoom video chats for a long time.

&lt;p>Just the other day, Java just celebrated its &lt;a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3544229/java-programming-language-celebrates-25-years.html" title="25th birthday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25th birthday&lt;/a>
, and from the time of its birth it was called &amp;ldquo;write once, run everywhere&amp;rdquo;, but more than 20 years later, there is still a deep gap between programming and actual production delivery. the world of IT is never short of concepts, and if a concept doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem, then it&amp;rsquo;s time for another layer of concepts. it&amp;rsquo;s been 6 years since Kubernetes was born, and it&amp;rsquo;s time for the post-Kubernetes era - the era of cloud-native applications!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This white paper will take you on a journey to explore the development path of cloud-native applications in the post-Kubernetes era.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Highlights of the ideas conveyed include.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cloud-native has passed through a savage growth period and is moving towards uniform application of standards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; native language does not fully describe the cloud-native application architecture, and the development and operation functions are heavily coupled in the configuration of resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Operator&amp;rsquo;s expansion of the Kubernetes ecosystem has led to the fragmentation of cloud-native applications, and there is an urgent need for a unified application definition standard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The essence of OAM is to separate the R&amp;amp;D and O&amp;amp;M concerns in the definition of cloud-native applications, and to further abstract resource objects, simplify and encompass everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Kubernetes Next Generation&amp;rdquo; refers to the fact that after Kubernetes became the infrastructure layer standard, the focus of the cloud-native ecology is being overtaken by the application layer, and the last two years have been a powerful exploration of the hot Service Mesh process, and the era of cloud-native application architecture based on Kubernetes is coming.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Kubernetes has become an established operating platform for cloud-native applications, and this white paper will expand with Kubernetes as the default platform, including an explanation of the OAM-based hierarchical model for cloud-native applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Establishment of the Cloud Native Community</title><link>https://sdmx.io/notice/cloud-native-community-announecement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 12:27:17 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://sdmx.io/notice/cloud-native-community-announecement/</guid><description>
&lt;p>At the beginning of 2020, due to the outbreak of the Crona-19 pandemic, employees around the world began to work at home. Though the distance between people grew farer, there was a group of people, who were us working in the cloud native area, gathered together for a common vision. During the past three months, we have set up the community management committee and used our spare time working together to complete the preparatory work for the community. Today we are here to announce the establishment of the Cloud Native Community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Software is eating the world. —— Marc Andreessen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This sentence has been quoted countless times, and with the rise of Cloud Native, we’d like to talk about “Cloud Native is eating the software.” As more and more enterprises migrate their services to the cloud, the original development mode of enterprises cannot adapt to the application scenarios in the cloud, and it is being reshaped to conform to the cloud native standard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what is cloud native? Cloud native is a collection of best practices in architecture, r&amp;amp;d process and team culture to support faster innovation, superior user experience, stable and reliable user service and efficient r&amp;amp;d. The relationship between the open source community and the cloud native is inseparable. It is the existence of the open source community, especially the end user community, that greatly promotes the continuous evolution of cloud native technologies represented by container, service mesh and microservices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) holds Cloud Native conference every year in the international community, which has a wide audience and great influence. But it was not held in China for the first time until 2018, after several successful international events. However, there are no independent foundations or neutral open source communities in China. In recent years, many cloud native enthusiasts in China have set up many communication groups and held many meetups, which are very popular. Many excellent open source projects have emerged in the cloud native field, but there is no organized neutral community for overall management. Under this background, the Cloud Native Community emerges at the right moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about">About&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud Native Community is an open source community with technology, temperature and passion. It was founded spontaneously by a group of industry elites who love open source and uphold the principle of consensus, co-governance, co-construction and sharing. The aim of the community is: connection, neutral, open source. We are based in China, facing the world, enterprise neutrality, focusing on open source, and giving feedback to open source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Introduction for the Steering Community：&lt;a href="https://cloudnative.to/en/team/" title="https://cloudnative.to/en/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://cloudnative.to/en/team/&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will gain the followings after joining the community:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Knowledge and news closer to the source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A more valuable network&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More professional and characteristic consultation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Opportunities to get closer to opinion leaders&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster and more efficient personal growth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More knowledge sharing and exposure opportunities&lt;/li>

&lt;p>2020 is indeed a bad start. In less than a month, I hardly heard any good news:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trump assassinated Major General Sulaymani of Iran; this pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan; the news that my basketball icon Kobe died of a helicopter crash really shocked me, and the Lakers said goodbye on the 24th. This gave me another spiritual blow during the Spring Festival, which was originally lacking in interest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2020 is bound to be a year deeply remembered in all humankind. In the last few days of the first month of the year, I decided to revise the website. The first reason was that I could n’t go out during the extended Chinese New Year holiday, and it was boring at home. And many pictures on the website were saved on Weibo map beds. The picture bed is unstable, causing many photos to be irretrievable; coupled with a habit of organizing the website every long holiday (the last revision of the website was completed during the National Day holiday in 2018, completed at home for 7 days), so I decided to The website has been revised again and it has become what it is now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="features">Features&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The website has the following features after this revision:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reorganize the website content, the structure is more reasonable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support email subscription&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Images are stored on Github&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Responsive static website, card design, better user experience&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The following paragraph is a release note from the Istio official blog &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/blog/2019/announcing-1.1/" title="https://istio.io/zh/blog/2019/announcing-1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://istio.io/zh/blog/2019/announcing-1.1/&lt;/a>
, which I translated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Istio was released at 4 a.m. Beijing time today and 1 p.m. Pacific time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the 1.0 release last July, we have done a lot to help people get Istio into production. We expected to release a lot of patches (six patches have been released so far!), But we are also working hard to add new features to the product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The theme for version 1.1 is &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Ready&amp;rdquo;. We are happy to see more and more companies using Istio in production, but as some big companies join in, Istio also encounters some bottlenecks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main areas we focus on include performance and scalability. As people gradually put Istio into production and use larger clusters to run more services with higher capacity, there may be some scaling and performance issues. Sidecar takes up too much resources and adds too much latency. The control plane (especially Pilot) consumes excessive resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We put a lot of effort into making the data plane and control plane more efficient. In the 1.1 performance test, we observed that sidecars typically require 0.5 vCPU to process 1000 rps. A single Pilot instance can handle 1000 services (and 2000 pods) and consumes 1.5 vCPUs and 2GB of memory. Sidecar adds 5 milliseconds at the 50th percentile and 10 milliseconds at the 99th percentile (the execution strategy will increase latency).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also completed the work of namespace isolation. You can use the Kubernetes namespace to enforce control boundaries to ensure that teams do not interfere with each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also improved multi-cluster functionality and usability. We listened to the community and improved the default settings for flow control and policies. We introduced a new component called Galley. Galley validates YAML configuration, reducing the possibility of configuration errors. Galley is also used in multi-cluster setups-collecting service discovery information from each Kubernetes cluster. We also support other multi-cluster topologies, including single control planes and multiple synchronous control planes, without the need for flat network support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://istio.io/about/notes/1.1/" title="release notes for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes for&lt;/a>
more information and details .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is more progress on this project. As we all know, Istio has many moving parts, and they take on too much work. To address this, we have recently established the &lt;a href="https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/WORKING-GROUPS.md#working-group-meetings" title="Usability Working Group (available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Usability Working Group (available&lt;/a>

with GitHub credentials to participate in the discussion!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to everyone who has contributed to Istio over the past few months-patching 1.0, adding features to 1.1, and extensive testing recently on 1.1. Special thanks to companies and users who work with us to install and upgrade to earlier versions to help us identify issues before they are released.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, go to the latest documentation and install version 1.1! Happy meshing!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few days ago I mentioned that kubernetes-vagrant-centos-cluster released v1.2.0 version to deploy a cloud-native experimental environment with one click. Someone in the Kubernetes and Service Mesh community asked me a long time ago to make a video to explain and demonstrate how to install Kubernetes and Istio Service Mesh, because I&amp;rsquo;m always busy, I&amp;rsquo;ve always made some time. Today, I will give a demo video, just don&amp;rsquo;t watch the video for a few minutes. In order to make this video, it took me half an hour to record, two hours to edit, and many years of shooting. , Editing, containers, virtual machines, Kubernetes, service grid experience. This is not so much a farewell as a new beginning.&lt;/p>

. This year, &lt;strong>8,000&lt;/strong> people participated. You should notice that Kubernetes has become more and more low-level. Cloud-native application developers do not need to pay much attention to it. Major companies are publishing their own cloud-native technology stack layouts, including IBM, VMware, SAP, Startups around this ecosystem are still emerging.

Although everyone said that Kubernetes has become boring, the conference about Kubernetes There is still a lot of content, and the use of CRD to extend Kubernetes usage is increasing. Service Mesh has begun to become hot. As can be seen from the live pictures above, there are a large number of participants on the site and related topics are also increasing.

&lt;p>This is a &lt;strong>postscript&lt;/strong> from the post- &lt;strong>Kubernetes&lt;/strong> era.

&lt;p>It has been more than 4 months since the previous version was released. During this period, &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/" title="Kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/" title="Prometheus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prometheus&lt;/a>
graduated from CNCF respectively and have matured commercially. These two projects have basically taken shape and will not change much in the future. Kubernetes was originally developed for container orchestration. In order to solve the problem of microservice deployment, Kubernetes has gained popularity. The current &lt;strong>microservices&lt;/strong> have gradually entered the &lt;strong>post-Kubernetes era&lt;/strong> . Service Mesh and cloud native redefine &lt;strong>microservices&lt;/strong> and distributed applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today, we are pleased to announce &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/about/notes/1.0" title="Istio 1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Istio 1.0&lt;/a>
. It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since the original 0.1 release. Since 0.1, Istio has grown rapidly with the help of a thriving community, contributors, and users. Many companies have successfully applied Istio to production today and have gained real value through the insight and control provided by Istio. We help large businesses and fast-growing startups such as &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/" title="eBay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay&lt;/a>

project is doing the same, and &lt;a href="https://apigee.com/" title="Apigee has" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apigee has&lt;/a>
announced plans to use it in their API management solution. These are just a few of the projects that the community added last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="features">Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since the 0.8 release, we have added some important new features, and more importantly, marked many existing features as Beta to indicate that they can be used in production. This is covered in more detail in the &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/about/notes/1.0/" title="release notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes&lt;/a>
, but it is worth mentioning:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Multiple Kubernetes clusters can now be &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/docs/setup/kubernetes/multicluster-install" title="added to a single grid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added to a single grid&lt;/a>
, enabling cross-cluster communication and consistent policy enforcement. Multi-cluster support is now Beta.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The network API for fine-grained control of traffic through the grid is now Beta. Explicitly modeling ingress and egress issues with gateways allows operations personnel to &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/blog/2018/v1alpha3-routing/" title="control the network topology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">control the network topology&lt;/a>
and meet access security requirements at the edge.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Two-way TLS can now be &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/docs/tasks/security/mtls-migration" title="launched incrementally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched incrementally&lt;/a>
without updating all clients of the service. This is a key feature that removes the barriers to deploying Istio on existing production.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mixer now supports &lt;a href="https://github.com/istio/istio/wiki/Out-Of-Process-gRPC-Adapter-Dev-Guide" title="developing out-of-process adapters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developing out-of-process adapters&lt;/a>
. This will be the default way to extend Mixer in an upcoming release, which will make it easier to build adapters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Envoy now fully evaluates the &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/docs/concepts/security/#%e8%ae%a4%e8%af%81" title="authorization policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorization policies&lt;/a>
that control service access locally , improving their performance and reliability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/docs/setup/kubernetes/helm-install/" title="Helm chart installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helm chart installation&lt;/a>
is now the recommended installation method, with a wealth of customization options to configure Istio to your needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We put a lot of effort into performance, including continuous regression testing, large-scale environmental simulation, and target repair. We are very happy with the results and will share details in the coming weeks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="next-step">Next step&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although this is an important milestone for the project, much work remains to be done. When working with adopters, we&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of important feedback about what to focus next. We&amp;rsquo;ve heard consistent topics about supporting hybrid clouds, installing modularity, richer network capabilities, and scalability for large-scale deployments. We have considered some feedback in the 1.0 release and we will continue to actively work on it in the coming months.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quick-start">Quick start&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are new to Istio and want to use it for deployment, we would love to hear from you. Check out our &lt;a href="https://istio.io/zh/docs/" title="documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation&lt;/a>

&lt;p>If there is a visual learning model and platform that provides infrastructure clusters for your operation, would you pay for it?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Two months ago, I met Jord in Kubernetes&amp;rsquo;s Slack channel, and later saw the link of MagicSandbox.io he (and possibly others) sent in the Facebook group of Taiwan Kubernetes User Group, and I clicked to apply for a trial Then, I received an email from Jord later, and he told me that he wanted to build a Kubernetes learning platform. That&amp;rsquo;s where the whole thing started, and then we had a couple of Zoom video chats for a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="about-magicsandbox">About MagicSandbox&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>MagicSandbox is a startup company. Jord (Dutch) is also a serial entrepreneur. He has studied at Sichuan University in China for 4 years since he was 19, and then returned to Germany. He worked as a PM at Boston Consulting Group and now works at Entrepreneur. First (Europe&amp;rsquo;s top venture capital / enterprise incubator) is also located in Berlin, Germany. He met Mislav (Croatian). Mislav is a full-stack engineer and has several entrepreneurial experiences. They have similar odors, and they hit it off. Decided to be committed to the Internet education industry and create a world-class software engineer education platform. They want to start with Kubernetes, first provide Internet-based Kubernetes theory and practice teaching, and then expand the topic to ElasticSearch, GraphQL, and so on. topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jord founded MagicSandbox in his home, and I became the face of MagicSandbox in China.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we are going to release the MagicSandbox Alpha version. This version is an immature version and is provided for everyone to try for free. Positive feedback is also welcome.&lt;/p>

. The code is hosted on GitHub. It is also the default data plane in the &lt;a href="https://istio.io/" title="Istio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Istio&lt;/a>

&lt;p>The official Envoy document excludes all articles in the two directories of the v1 API reference and the v2 API reference. There are more than 120 documents. The length of the documents varies. The original English official documents use the RST format. I manually converted them into Markdown format and compiled using Gitbook. A GitHub Issue was generated according to the path of the document relative to the home directory. Friends who want to participate in translation can &lt;a href="https://jimmysong.io/about" title="contact me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact me&lt;/a>

&lt;p>Many people asked me how jimmysong.io made this website. I think it is necessary to write a book to popularize the knowledge of static website construction and Hugo as a tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This manual will guide you how to use Hugo to build a static website for personal blog or project display.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Teach you how to build a static website from scratch. This does not require much programming and development experience and time investment, and basically does not require much cost (except for personalized domain names). You can quickly build and Launch a website.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From now on I have my own independent domain name &lt;a href="http://jimmysong.io/" title="jimmysong.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jimmysong.io&lt;/a>

still accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why use .io as the suffix? Because this is &lt;strong>The First Step to Cloud Native!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why choose today? Because today is August 18, the days are easy to remember.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS domain names are registered in &lt;a href="http://www.namecheap.com/" title="namecheap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">namecheap&lt;/a>
